  "NARRATIVE AND OFFICER ACTIONS": "On Saturday, February 15th, 2020, at approximately 9:21 p.m., I, Officer Eric Blanchard, badge number 1201, PID number 265039, took a report for criminal mischief to a vehicle from the residence at 411 Avenue B in Sinton, Texas. Upon my arrival at the location, I spoke with David Jimenez, who provided his daughter's information, Stephanie Crystal Jimenez, as the victim of the incident. David informed me that Stephanie's truck, a 1999 Ford F-350 with Texas license plate DDZ 8060, had its tires punctured by a subject riding a bicycle. The subject was reportedly carrying some type of cutting device used to puncture all four tires. When David showed me the truck, I could hear hissing coming from the front right tire as air escaped. The left side tires were completely flat, and I observed puncture marks on those tires. The right rear tire also had a puncture mark, but there was no air escaping from it. The tires were identified as Goodyear tires, size 235/65R16C, valued at $150 each. David mentioned that he was alerted to the incident by his neighbor, Mary Tijerina, who witnessed the subject puncturing the tires. I spoke with Mrs. Tijerina, who stated that she saw the subject on the bicycle wearing a black sweater approach Stephanie's truck, alerted by her dog's barking. She observed the subject puncturing the tires and then saw the individual flee towards 4th Street. However, due to the nighttime conditions, she could not discern whether the suspect was male or female, only noting a slim build. I inquired if David had any surveillance cameras, but he reported that he did not. I conducted a search of the neighborhood for any possible cameras that might have captured the event or the suspect on the bike, but I was unable to locate any. During my discussion with Stephanie, she expressed a desire for the matter to be investigated by the police department. I photographed the damage to the truck and generated a case report, which I sent to criminal investigations for follow-up. I had no further involvement in the situation.",
